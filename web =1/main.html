    <h2>Moon light</h2>
    <p>The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite. Together with Earth it forms the Earth-Moon satellite system.
       It is about one-quarter of Earth in diameter (comparable to the width of Australia).[16] In the Solar System 
       it is the fifth largest satellite, larger than any of the known dwarf planets and the largest (and most massive) satellite of 
       a planet relative to the planet.[f] The Moon is a planetary-mass object that formed a differentiated rocky body, making it a 
       satellite planet under the geophysical definitions of the term.[17] It lacks any significant atmosphere, hydrosphere, or magnetic 
       field. Its surface gravity is about one-sixth of Earth's (0.1654 g). Jupiter's moon Io is the only satellite in the Solar System
        known to have a higher surface gravity and density.Orbiting Earth at an average distance of 384,400 km (238,900 mi), or about 30 times Earth's diameter, its gravitational 
        influence very slowly lengthens Earth's day and is the main driver of Earth's tides. The Moon's orbit around Earth has a sidereal 
        period of 27.3 days. During each synodic period of 29.5 days, the amount of visible surface illuminated by the Sun varies from none
         up to 100%, resulting in lunar phases that form the basis for the months of a lunar calendar. The Moon is tidally locked to Earth,
          which means that the length of a full rotation of the Moon on its own axis causes its same side (the near side) to always face Earth,
           and the somewhat longer lunar day is the same as the synodic period. However, 59% of the total lunar surface can be seen from Earth 
           through shifts in perspective due to libration.most widely accepted origin explanation posits that the Moon formed 4.51 billion years ago, not long after Earth, out of the
           debris from a giant impact between the planet and a hypothesized Mars-sized body called Theia. It then receded to a wider orbit 
           because of tidal interaction with the Earth. The near side of the Moon is marked by dark volcanic maria ("seas"), which fill the 
           spaces between bright ancient crustal highlands and prominent impact craters. Most of the large impact basins and mare surfaces were in
            place by the end of the Imbrian period, some three billion years ago. The lunar surface is relatively non-reflective, with a reflectance 
            just slightly brighter than that of worn asphalt. However, because it has a large angular diameter, the full moon is the brightest
             celestial object in the night sky. The Moon's apparent size is nearly the same as that of the Sun, allowing it to cover the Sun almost 
             completely during a total solar eclipse.<br>
